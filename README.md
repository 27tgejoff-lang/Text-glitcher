I originally made this for one of my roleplay characters.

I was frustrated that I couldn't find anything that made him talk in a glitchy way - at least, not in the exact way I envisioned. So I made my own text glitcher.

It was meant to be a personal tool, just for me. But things happened, I polished it up enough for public use, and figured... why not share it?

It does partially censor curse words, mostly because that fit the character I made it for. It's not meant to police people or tell anyone how to talk. If you'd rather disable that, feel more than free to remove the censor section in the code. I really don't care.

This was built around one specific character, so you might notice some flavor choices that reflect that. But if it helps your character or project too awesome.
