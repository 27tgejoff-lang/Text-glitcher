I originally made this for one of my characters I use in role-playing. 
I got frustrated with the fact that I couldn't find anything that would make him talk in a glitchy manner, or at least, not in the exact way I envisioned. 
for this reason, I made my own text glitcher. it was originally going to be just for me, but hey, things happen, I made it polished enough for a public release, so why not?
It does partially censor cuss words, since I thought I would fit the character most, this was not some attempt to police people. again, this was intended for my character alone, so there's obviously going to be some features keeping said character in mind. feel more than three to remove the section that sensors cusses, I really don't care.
